## Overview

This skill enables the creation of stunning visual artworks in PNG and PDF formats, drawing from principles of design philosophy such as balance, contrast, harmony, and emphasis. Ideal for generating posters, banners, illustrations, or static designs that convey messages effectively.

## Best Practices

- **Design Principles**: Incorporate balance (symmetrical/asymmetrical), contrast (color/value), rhythm (repetition), and unity (cohesion).
- **Color Theory**: Use complementary colors for vibrancy, analogous for harmony, and consider accessibility with sufficient contrast ratios.
- **Composition**: Apply the rule of thirds, leading lines, and focal points to guide the viewer's eye.
- **Typography**: Choose fonts wisely; serif for tradition, sans-serif for modernity, ensuring readability.
- **Tools and Formats**: Output in PNG for web/graphics, PDF for print/documents, optimizing resolution (300 DPI for print).

## Usage Instructions

- **Prompt Structure**: Describe the art piece (e.g., "Create a poster for a music festival with vibrant colors and dynamic typography").
- **Elements to Include**: Specify dimensions, colors, themes, text, images, and style (e.g., minimalist, abstract, realistic).
- **Output Options**: Request PNG for digital use or PDF for vector-based designs.
- **Customization**: Incorporate user-provided elements like logos, photos, or specific palettes.

## Pro Tips

- Use negative space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Test designs for scalability and adaptability across media.
- Leverage cultural references or symbolism for deeper impact.
- Iterate based on feedback: refine colors, layouts, or elements as needed.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Overloading with too many elements leading to visual chaos.
- Ignoring color blindness accessibility.
- Poor resolution causing pixelation in prints.
- Mismatched fonts or inconsistent styling.

Master these to create art that captivates and communicates like a design pro.
